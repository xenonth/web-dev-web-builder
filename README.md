### Description
A CLI for manager's to input their employee's contact information is constructed and placed in the output directory under the filename index.html

This program requires the following to be installed in order to run succesfully,

* path

### Instructions
To run the program make sure that the file's directory is open in your terminal, run node app.js and answer the manager questions.
